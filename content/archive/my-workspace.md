This post is the last in the [Support Driven Writing Challenge](https://supportdriven.com/2016/10/21/stretch-your-typing-fingers-support-driven-6-week-writing-challenge/) series that I've been participating in lately, albeit a bit late. This post is about my workspace.

As a [fellow support driven community member](https://inside.recruiterbox.com/welcome-to-my-desk-d215ae7507d6#.cjofla6wu) and remote worker Chelsea noted, being remote means that I can work from anywhere. In my case, it's mostly true (given that I work third shift). My space has been a place that I intentionally crafted to be a place that would make going from a first shift job to a third shift one tolerable, if not at least somewhat enjoyable.

That's the hoss of a desk that I hand-built. It's iron pipe and stained pine, and all of 300 lbs (trust me, I attempted to lift it myself). I had previously used a [Standesk 2200](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html) while I was at Rackspace, but found the prospects of standing all night to be a bit...unpleasant.

I wanted my desk to be something solid, rugged, and something that would hold up to not only normal work, but something that would also function as sort of a work bench when I tinker with electronics. I also wanted it to be something that I could work at all night and not grow too terribly bored at, which is why I added the little terrarium you see in the picture. 

The other elements of the desk are as follows:

* 2 x Dell 2715q monitors
* Custom desktop dual booting Windows/Linux(Korora)
* Desk fan to circulate the air
* Filing cabinet for various widgets/files
* Logitech Z533 speakers 
* [Sentey gaming headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMR8RVS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Logitech Master MX mouse](http://www.pcconnection.com/product/logitech-mx-master-wireless-mouse/910-004337/18954486)
* [Corsair Strafe Keyboard](https://www.cdw.com/shop/products/Corsair-Gaming-STRAFE-Mechanical-Cherry-MX-Red-keyboard-English-US/3954761.aspx?pfm=qud)
* My beloved whiteboard (5x3)

Overall, I feel that the setup has worked well for working on third shift when I'm not doing work at Starbucks/other coffee shops. The only downside will be when the occassion next strikes us to move...I think I'll use movers for the desk.
