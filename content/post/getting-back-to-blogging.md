It's been five years since I last wrote anything here. Five years! That's a lifetime in tech years. 

After letting this blog gather digital dust, I decided it was time to breathe some life back into it. The first order of business? Updating that ancient theme that hasn't been maintained since... well, let's not talk about that.

## The Migration

I've just migrated from the old Blackburn theme to the modern [Stack theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It's clean, it's fast, and most importantly - it's actively maintained. 

The old posts are archived, and I'm starting fresh with a few select pieces that still feel relevant. Sometimes you need to clear the deck to move forward.

## What's Next?

I'm not making any grand promises about posting schedules or content calendars. But I am excited to have a working blog again, ready for when inspiration strikes. Whether it's tech discoveries, brewing experiments, or the occasional banjo tune - this space is ready for whatever comes next.

Here's to new beginnings and old domains. ðŸŽ¸
