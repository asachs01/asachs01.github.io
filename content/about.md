### A Quick Intro

Hi there and thank you for stopping by! I'm Aaron. I'm a academic-turned-Linux geek who loves beer (not just consuming, but making beer), tinkering with all sorts of things, and am what you might call a "[multipotentialite](http://puttylike.com/terminology/)".

I've been a Linux dude for a while, and am currently at [Sensu](https://sensu.io), where I'm a Customer Reliability Engineer.

### What this Blog is About
I'm mostly using the blog right now to document the things that I'm learning along the way in Customer Reliability, Linux stuff, and general tech. For the most part, it's one-liners, as well as the things I tinker with. There will be other topics that I cover, just stay tuned. If you're wanting to reach out, you can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asachs01).
