I've posted previously about [homebrewing](http://aaron.sachs.blog/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/) and have been brewing for almost three years now. Back in April, I took to destroying a perfectly good mini fridge to turn it into a kegerator.

As any homebrewer can tell you, bottling is a pain in the ass. The delabling (if you're reusing bottles), the santization, and the bottle carbonization makes for a rather long and laborious process. Because I'd finally had it with bottling, I decided that kegging would be a wiser choice since:

1. Less time would be spent on bottling
2. Carbonization would be better controlled
3. For most ales, production time would be cut by a week

Thankfully, my assumptions have proven to be true. So let's walk through what it took to make the kegerator.

### The Build
I started off with the following hardware:

* [Whirlpool 4.3 cu ft mini fridge](https://www.amazon.com/Whirlpool-Stainless-Compact-Refrigerator-Fridge/dp/B00XQLQXMY)
* [Chrome plated dual faucet tower](http://www.beveragefactory.com/draftbeer/towers/doublefaucet/D4743DT___6843.shtml)
* [Draft Brewer Flex Keg System](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/draft-brewer-flex-keg-system)
* [Aluminum CO2 Tank - 5 lb](http://www.austinhomebrew.com/Aluminum-CO2-Tank--5-lb_p_4693.html)
* [Surface Mount Drip Tray](http://www.beveragefactory.com/draftbeer/driptray/cutout/kegco-surface-mount-drip-tray-seco1610.html)

I won't go through the whole process of assembling, since the post over at [missionarybrewer](https://missionarybrewer.wordpress.com/how-to-build-your-own-kegerator/) (which my build was largely based on) covers the steps more than sufficiently. I will mention a few gotchas for the particular fridge I used:

* There are coolant lines running over in the upper rear left corner. DON'T drill back there
* The 4.3 cu ft size is just a hair too small for both kegs to fit comfortably. I ended up using a multitool to carve out the front of the door, as well as the molding for holding the shelves so that the kegs would fit.

Now, some pics of the kegerator:
