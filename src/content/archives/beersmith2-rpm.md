I've been trying to up my beer-making game, and remembered that I had a license to [BeerSmith2](http://beersmith.com/), but didn't see that they had any packages available for Fedora/Fedora remixes. So, I did a thing and have [BeerSmith2 2.3.7 in RPM format](https://github.com/asachs01/beersmith2rpm).

Cheers,

Aaron
