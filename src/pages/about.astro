			<p>
				Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm an Engineering Lead at <a href="https://wyretech.com">WYRE Technology</a> in Chattanooga, where I help
				businesses actually make sense of AI instead of just talking about it. I also do a lot of
				infrastructure work for higher education clients and build way too many side projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				I got into tech from an academic background, which mostly means I ask a lot of questions
				and can't stop tinkering with things.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of work, I play bluegrass around town—it's a good excuse to unplug and pick
				with people. I've got kids, so free time is relative.
			</p>
			<p>
				This blog is where I write about whatever I'm learning or building. Sometimes that's
				technical stuff, sometimes it's not. If you want to get in touch,
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asachs01">LinkedIn</a> is probably the best way.
