One of the things I always like asking about it their setup and getting to know what they use on brew day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to do a HIB (How I Homebrew) post and let you know what I started brewing on, and where I&amp;rsquo;ve progressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="for-starters">For Starters
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>When I first started brewing, I started on a hand-me-down &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mrbeer.com/beer-making-kits/craft-beer-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mr. Beer&lt;/a> kit that had solidified LME with it. I went to Walmart and picked up a cheap 3 gallon aluminum kettle, and brewed my first beer (an ESB).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I realized that I wantd to brew larger batches and to do that, I&amp;rsquo;d need to upgrade. I upgraded my fermentation vessel (the Mr. Beer LBK) first. This was great, but I was essentially making extract in my undersized brew kettle, which I upgraded next. This began a long process of creating the piecemeal setup that I currently have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="currently-using">Currently Using&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This is the fun part for me. I&amp;rsquo;ll skip over all the sequential upgrades, and get to the good stuff. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m currently using, and am quite happy with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 x &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.heb.com/product-detail/imusa-aluminum-tamale-steamer/861634" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>8gal Tamale Steamers&lt;/a> (boil kettle &amp;amp; HLT)&lt;/li>

>Igloo mash tun&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some copper tubing from Home Depot (immersion chiller)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2x PVC buckets (primary fermenters)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2x 6gal glass carboys (secondary fermenters)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bayou Classic w/ 6&amp;quot; burner&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But wait! There&amp;rsquo;s more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got some incoming upgrades, namely a 10&amp;quot; burner for the Bayou Classic stand, and a &lt;a class="link" href="https://jadedbrewing.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jaded Brewing Hydra&lt;/a>! I&amp;rsquo;m hoping these will shorten my brew day. Not that I &lt;em>want&lt;/em> them to be short, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for them to be a bit more efficient. Anywho, that&amp;rsquo;s the current setup!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving to Kegging my Homebrew</title><link>https://aaron.sachs.blog/archive/moving-to-kegging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 17:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaron.sachs.blog/archive/moving-to-kegging/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted previously about &lt;a class="link" href="http://aaron.sachs.blog/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>homebrewing&lt;/a> and have been brewing for almost three years now. Back in April, I took to destroying a perfectly good mini fridge to turn it into a kegerator.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As any homebrewer can tell you, bottling is a pain in the ass. The delabling (if you&amp;rsquo;re reusing bottles), the santization, and the bottle carbonization makes for a rather long and laborious process. Because I&amp;rsquo;d finally had it with bottling, I decided that kegging would be a wiser choice since:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Less time would be spent on bottling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carbonization would be better controlled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For most ales, production time would be cut by a week&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Thankfully, my assumptions have proven to be true. So let&amp;rsquo;s walk through what it took to make the kegerator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-build">The Build
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I started off with the following hardware:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Whirlpool-Stainless-Compact-Refrigerator-Fridge/dp/B00XQLQXMY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Whirlpool 4.3 cu ft mini fridge&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

>Chrome plated dual faucet tower&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

>Draft Brewer Flex Keg System&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.austinhomebrew.com/Aluminum-CO2-Tank--5-lb_p_4693.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Aluminum CO2 Tank - 5 lb&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.beveragefactory.com/draftbeer/driptray/cutout/kegco-surface-mount-drip-tray-seco1610.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Surface Mount Drip Tray&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go through the whole process of assembling, since the post over at &lt;a class="link" href="https://missionarybrewer.wordpress.com/how-to-build-your-own-kegerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>missionarybrewer&lt;/a> (which my build was largely based on) covers the steps more than sufficiently. I will mention a few gotchas for the particular fridge I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are coolant lines running over in the upper rear left corner. DON&amp;rsquo;T drill back there&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The 4.3 cu ft size is just a hair too small for both kegs to fit comfortably. I ended up using a multitool to carve out the front of the door, as well as the molding for holding the shelves so that the kegs would fit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, some pics of the kegerator:&lt;/p>
