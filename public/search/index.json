[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s been five years since I last wrote anything here. Five years! That\u0026rsquo;s a lifetime in tech years.\nAfter letting this blog gather digital dust, I decided it was time to breathe some life back into it. The first order of business? Updating that ancient theme that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been maintained since\u0026hellip; well, let\u0026rsquo;s not talk about that.\nThe Migration I\u0026rsquo;ve just migrated from the old Blackburn theme to the modern Stack theme. It\u0026rsquo;s clean, it\u0026rsquo;s fast, and most importantly - it\u0026rsquo;s actively maintained.\nThe old posts are archived, and I\u0026rsquo;m starting fresh with a few select pieces that still feel relevant. Sometimes you need to clear the deck to move forward.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? I\u0026rsquo;m not making any grand promises about posting schedules or content calendars. But I am excited to have a working blog again, ready for when inspiration strikes. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s tech discoveries, brewing experiments, or the occasional banjo tune - this space is ready for whatever comes next.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to new beginnings and old domains. ðŸŽ¸\n","date":"2025-08-25T21:00:00-05:00","permalink":"https://aaron.sachs.blog/p/getting-back-to-blogging/","title":"Getting Back to Blogging"},{"content":"Working in tech can be all-consuming. The constant learning, the on-call rotations, the endless stream of new technologies - it\u0026rsquo;s exhilarating but exhausting. A few years ago, I found myself staring at screens from dawn to dusk, losing touch with the physical world.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I discovered homebrewing.\nThe Perfect Antidote Homebrewing offered everything that my tech job didn\u0026rsquo;t:\nTangible results: You can hold a bottle of beer you made Patience required: Good beer takes weeks, not microseconds Science meets art: Precision matters, but so does creativity Community: Local homebrew clubs are full of passionate, helpful people Failure is okay: A bad batch teaches you more than a perfect one Lessons Learned The brewing process taught me valuable lessons that applied back to my tech work:\nDocumentation matters: Recipe notes are like code comments Iteration is key: Each batch builds on the last Simplicity often wins: The best beers aren\u0026rsquo;t always the most complex Share your work: Getting feedback makes you better Finding Your Balance You don\u0026rsquo;t need to take up homebrewing specifically. Find something that gets you away from the keyboard, engages different parts of your brain, and produces something real. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s woodworking, gardening, cooking, or playing music - having a physical creative outlet can save you from digital burnout.\nThe next time you\u0026rsquo;re debugging code at 2 AM, remember: there\u0026rsquo;s a world beyond the screen, and it\u0026rsquo;s worth exploring.\n","date":"2018-03-15T10:00:00-05:00","permalink":"https://aaron.sachs.blog/p/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/","title":"How Homebrewing Saved Me from Burnout"}]
