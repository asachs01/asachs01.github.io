One of the things I always like asking about it their setup and getting to know what they use on brew day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to do a HIB (How I Homebrew) post and let you know what I started brewing on, and where I&amp;rsquo;ve progressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="for-starters">For Starters
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>When I first started brewing, I started on a hand-me-down &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mrbeer.com/beer-making-kits/craft-beer-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mr. Beer&lt;/a> kit that had solidified LME with it. I went to Walmart and picked up a cheap 3 gallon aluminum kettle, and brewed my first beer (an ESB).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I realized that I wantd to brew larger batches and to do that, I&amp;rsquo;d need to upgrade. I upgraded my fermentation vessel (the Mr. Beer LBK) first. This was great, but I was essentially making extract in my undersized brew kettle, which I upgraded next. This began a long process of creating the piecemeal setup that I currently have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="currently-using">Currently Using&amp;hellip;
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This is the fun part for me. I&amp;rsquo;ll skip over all the sequential upgrades, and get to the good stuff. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m currently using, and am quite happy with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 x &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.heb.com/product-detail/imusa-aluminum-tamale-steamer/861634" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>8gal Tamale Steamers&lt;/a> (boil kettle &amp;amp; HLT)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.austinhomebrew.com/Igloo-Cooler-Mash-Tun-with-False-Bottom--10-Gallon_p_5722.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Igloo mash tun&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some copper tubing from Home Depot (immersion chiller)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2x PVC buckets (primary fermenters)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2x 6gal glass carboys (secondary fermenters)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bayou Classic w/ 6&amp;quot; burner&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But wait! There&amp;rsquo;s more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got some incoming upgrades, namely a 10&amp;quot; burner for the Bayou Classic stand, and a &lt;a class="link" href="https://jadedbrewing.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jaded Brewing Hydra&lt;/a>! I&amp;rsquo;m hoping these will shorten my brew day. Not that I &lt;em>want&lt;/em> them to be short, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for them to be a bit more efficient. Anywho, that&amp;rsquo;s the current setup!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Homebrewing Saved Me from Burnout</title><link>https://aaron.sachs.blog/p/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://aaron.sachs.blog/p/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/</guid><description>&lt;p>Working in tech can be all-consuming. The constant learning, the on-call rotations, the endless stream of new technologies - it&amp;rsquo;s exhilarating but exhausting. A few years ago, I found myself staring at screens from dawn to dusk, losing touch with the physical world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s when I discovered homebrewing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-perfect-antidote">The Perfect Antidote
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Homebrewing offered everything that my tech job didn&amp;rsquo;t:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tangible results&lt;/strong>: You can hold a bottle of beer you made&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Patience required&lt;/strong>: Good beer takes weeks, not microseconds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Science meets art&lt;/strong>: Precision matters, but so does creativity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community&lt;/strong>: Local homebrew clubs are full of passionate, helpful people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Failure is okay&lt;/strong>: A bad batch teaches you more than a perfect one&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The brewing process taught me valuable lessons that applied back to my tech work:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Documentation matters&lt;/strong>: Recipe notes are like code comments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Iteration is key&lt;/strong>: Each batch builds on the last&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simplicity often wins&lt;/strong>: The best beers aren&amp;rsquo;t always the most complex&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share your work&lt;/strong>: Getting feedback makes you better&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="finding-your-balance">Finding Your Balance
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to take up homebrewing specifically. Find something that gets you away from the keyboard, engages different parts of your brain, and produces something real. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s woodworking, gardening, cooking, or playing music - having a physical creative outlet can save you from digital burnout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time you&amp;rsquo;re debugging code at 2 AM, remember: there&amp;rsquo;s a world beyond the screen, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving to Kegging my Homebrew</title><link>https://aaron.sachs.blog/archive/moving-to-kegging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 17:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaron.sachs.blog/archive/moving-to-kegging/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted previously about &lt;a class="link" href="http://aaron.sachs.blog/how-homebrewing-saved-me-from-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>homebrewing&lt;/a> and have been brewing for almost three years now. Back in April, I took to destroying a perfectly good mini fridge to turn it into a kegerator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://aaron.sachs.blog/img/IMG_20170403_105320.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As any homebrewer can tell you, bottling is a pain in the ass. The delabling (if you&amp;rsquo;re reusing bottles), the santization, and the bottle carbonization makes for a rather long and laborious process. Because I&amp;rsquo;d finally had it with bottling, I decided that kegging would be a wiser choice since:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Less time would be spent on bottling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carbonization would be better controlled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For most ales, production time would be cut by a week&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Thankfully, my assumptions have proven to be true. So let&amp;rsquo;s walk through what it took to make the kegerator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-build">The Build
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I started off with the following hardware:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

>Whirlpool 4.3 cu ft mini fridge&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

>Chrome plated dual faucet tower&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

>Draft Brewer Flex Keg System&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.austinhomebrew.com/Aluminum-CO2-Tank--5-lb_p_4693.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Aluminum CO2 Tank - 5 lb&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

>Surface Mount Drip Tray&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go through the whole process of assembling, since the post over at &lt;a class="link" href="https://missionarybrewer.wordpress.com/how-to-build-your-own-kegerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>missionarybrewer&lt;/a> (which my build was largely based on) covers the steps more than sufficiently. I will mention a few gotchas for the particular fridge I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are coolant lines running over in the upper rear left corner. DON&amp;rsquo;T drill back there&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The 4.3 cu ft size is just a hair too small for both kegs to fit comfortably. I ended up using a multitool to carve out the front of the door, as well as the molding for holding the shelves so that the kegs would fit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, some pics of the kegerator:&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the most common thing for someone to claim as having a positive impact on one&amp;rsquo;s life. But beer saved me, in a weird sort of way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last winter, I was miserable. My wife saw it, my coworkers saw it, and after many conversations that highlighted my incessant complaining about my former employer, I finally admitted that I was in fact, a bit of a mess. My symptoms included:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Being a bit of an ass to my wife, whom I love fiercely&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being a outright ass to some of my customers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complaining about the lack of necessary change occurring in my department&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And generally complaining about anything I could find a reason to complain about&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short, I was bitter, overly critical, and no one wanted to be around me&amp;hellip;including me. I&amp;rsquo;d woken up several times during the winter months and thought, &amp;ldquo;Not again. I can&amp;rsquo;t do another day of this. Why in the hell did I move 1,100 miles for this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s when one of my dearest friends and mentors suggested that I take up a hobby. He and I&amp;rsquo;d been talking over Slack and he asked me, &amp;ldquo;Do you have any hobbies?&amp;rdquo; Dumbstruck, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall having anything to do during my free time other than study for certifications and try and bone up on all things *NIX-y. That night, I decided that I was going to take a week and learn how to homebrew. That was the best decision for my mental health that I&amp;rsquo;d made in a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned to a coworker that I was going to take some time to homebrew. He generously gave me his kit, noting that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t using it. After a month, I had a passable &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ESB&lt;/a>. Mind you, it was a bit watery, but it was by no means terrible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that watered-down, bubbly bit of brew, I found a hobby. I found something that would keep me from being completely burnt out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in why brewing staved off the burnout. After all, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that I chose brewing as a hobby with the express purpose of keeping my sanity. I had chosen homebrewing on a whim, namely because I like good beer and wanted to make my own &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until Christmas that my mentor hit on something in a &lt;a class="link" href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2015/12/day-8-be-better-engineer-dont-do.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SysAdvent&lt;/a> post that he wrote. To quote him: &amp;ldquo;Brewing beer is a mixture of being methodical, something that is near and dear to all our hearts, and art.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d found a medium of expression that allowed me to still be methodical (something that was required in solving the types of problems a systems administrator solves), and be creative&amp;hellip;the element that was missing from day-to-day duties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>INTP&lt;/a>, I need space to create. Relentless break-fixing is something I&amp;rsquo;ve since discovered contributes to a regular cycle of burnout for me. If I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in that constant cycle, I&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably start becoming a bit of an ass again. Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few hobbies now, and one that I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I love doing.&lt;/p>
